# Mechanical Metamaterial project

This repositroy contains the scripts relevant to the publication ---, and it is divided into two subdirectories: the image registration, which reconstructs the strain and displacement fields from experimentally taken images, and the FEM, which simulates the mechanical compression assuming linear elasticity with the aid of the finite element method.
